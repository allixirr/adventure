# Jim's bizarre adventure
### 1. Branching <br>
So you will notice that there are branches. Different people, different project versions, different branches you should upload to. They'll have changes with them, but the branch called "main" is the original project. **IMPORTANT!! Please do not upload to the main branch, instead create a new branch and upload there instead.**

### 2. Do you need RENPY? <br>
To develop it, yes, to play it, no.
